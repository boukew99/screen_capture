# Screen Capture Addon
Ready to be used Screen Capture scene. Just add the scene and call with `capture()` with an optional parameter for cropping. Easily customizable since it just uses standard Godot functionality and is MIT Licencsed. Includes a test scene (main) to show three options and how to use them. Also includes a camera sound effect on capture. Should be straightforward, enjoy!
